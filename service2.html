                <a href="#" href = "https://aggiecodingclub.com/" id="replaceableLink"> During my time at Texas A&M, I have served as an officer for the Aggie Coding Club on campus. ACC works to empower students from all walks of life to code by fostering a diverse and welcoming environment for them to learn and interact. I work to plan workshops for students to learn computer science concepts that will serve them well in industry. Such workshops include topics like generative AI, web scraping, and APIs. I also work to plan social events to foster community among the members in hopes that they are able to foster life long relationships and feel more welcome here within the computer science department as Texas A&M. Finally, officers organize projects for students to practice being project managers and software developers, as students work for a semester towards the goal of creating a viable product to present at the end of the semester. Under officer guidance, students learn about working on a team, writing productive code, and building professional products.
