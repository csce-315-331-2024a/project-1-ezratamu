    <h2>Camp Peniel</h2>
    <p>
        During each summer of high school, I served as a camp counselor, where for a week I would supervise a cabin of campers for 24 hours a day, staying with them for all of their activities. During weeks where I did not have a cabin, I served as a dish washer or a barn hand.

    <h2>Aggie Coding Club</h2>
    <p>
        During my time at Texas A&M, I have served as an officer for the Aggie Coding Club on campus. ACC works to empower students from all walks of life to code by fostering a diverse and welcoming environment for them to learn and interact.
